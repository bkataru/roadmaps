# roadmaps
documenting how I've learned, learn, and plan to learn things I find interesting

## what is this?
- the goal of this repository is to chart out my learning journey across time.
- since I do not have perfect recall, any updates come in a highly non-linear fashion and I obviously cannot remember everything that I've used to learn what I do know so far so i might have omitted some resources.
- the hope is that by mapping out what & how I've learned/will learn, I can keep track of how far I've come and also keep myself accountable to have realistic learning goals by not queueing up an impossible list of resources that I will never finish.
- the categorization is arbitrary and there will be duplicates/overlap between sections/categories. I don't care about this and would much rather not waste my time trying to optimize it.
